GLM.js
======

Responsive [generalized linear models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) in pure Javascript. This tool is useful for responsive feedback when doing data cleansing or adjusting parameters that actually change the data.

This is essentially a port of Wes Mckinney's python GLM implementation that uses the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm in the excellent [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) library.
